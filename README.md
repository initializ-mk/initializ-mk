## About Me

I'm an engineering leader with 19+ years of experience building platforms and products across the cloud-native ecosystem. Before founding initializ.ai, I held leadership roles at **VMware Tanzu**, **Pivotal Software**, **Cox Communications**, and **Infosys** — shipping products used by thousands of enterprises worldwide.

I'm a **Georgia Institute of Technology** alumnus and an **Arctic Code Vault Contributor** on GitHub. My core expertise spans Kubernetes, Cloud Native infrastructure, AI/ML, the Spring ecosystem, and DevSecOps.

Currently, I'm focused on making AI deployment as easy as deploying web apps.
